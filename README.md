## About this repository
We present the development of an interactive web application designed to allow the general public to explore and analyze multiple variables related to the interplanetary magnetic field and its components. The application was developed as part of a NASA challenge and is accompanied by code in {Jupyter Notebook} with Python that incorporates wavelet transforms for more detailed analysis. In this article, we describe the methodology used in the development of the web application, as well as the results obtained through its implementation.

## Introduction
The interplanetary magnetic field is a fundamental piece of space physics, playing a critical role in the interaction between the solar wind and the planets of the solar system, particularly for the life in our Earth planet. Understanding the characteristics and dynamics of this field is essential to advance our knowledge of space physics and predict solar events that may affect Earth and other space missions.

Magnetic reconnection priest1984magnetic, schwenn2013physics in the context of the Sun refers to the process in which magnetic field lines in the solar atmosphere, especially in the solar corona, change their configuration. This occurs when initially separated magnetic field lines approach and join together. When these lines reconnect, they release a large amount of energy in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

In the Sun, magnetic reconnection is a significant cause of explosive solar events. During reconnection, the stored magnetic energy is converted into thermal and kinetic energy, resulting in solar flares that can affect communications on Earth and satellite navigation systems, among other things. It can also lead to coronal mass ejections, which are massive ejections of solar material into space, and when these CMEs impact Earth, they can disrupt conditions in the Earth's magnetosphere and cause geomagnetic storms.

Understanding and studying magnetic reconnection is of critical importance for various aspects of life on Earth, technology, and communications. Here are some key reasons:

- Earth's Protection from Solar Storms: Magnetic reconnection on the Sun can lead to massive solar eruptions and coronal mass ejections that, when they reach Earth, can severely disrupt our magnetosphere and satellite communications. Understanding this process is essential for developing early warning systems and risk mitigation strategies.
- Space Technology and Satellites: Satellites and spacecraft in Earth's orbit are constantly exposed to solar wind radiation and charged particles. Magnetic reconnection can negatively impact their operation and lifespan. Studying it is crucial for designing resilient space technology and reliable navigation systems.
- Scientific Research: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in plasma physics and astrophysics. Studying it helps us better understand the behavior of plasmas in the universe, from the Sun to the far reaches of interplanetary space.
- Earth Applications: In addition to its relevance in space, magnetic reconnection also occurs in Earth's magnetosphere. Understanding it is vital for protecting power grids, navigation systems, and communications during extreme geomagnetic events.
- Technological Advancements: Research into magnetic reconnection can have applications beyond solar storm protection. It can inspire advances in energy generation and control, as well as in nuclear fusion, potentially revolutionizing how we obtain energy in the future.


The phenomenon of magnetic reconnection is essential for Earth's safety, technological development, understanding the universe, and advancing cutting-edge technologies. Its ongoing study plays a crucial role in safeguarding our society and driving progress in science and technology.

NASA issued a challenge to develop an interactive web application that would allow anyone to explore and analyze data related to the interplanetary magnetic field. The goal was to provide an educational and research tool accessible to the general public.
